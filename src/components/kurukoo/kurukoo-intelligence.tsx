  ["Understands what you mean, not just what you say", "Kurukoo interprets natural language, intent, requirements, urgency, location, timing, and the outcome you want."],
  ["Understands context", "It remembers what you were discussing, recognises follow-up questions, handles interruptions, and lets you return to an earlier request without starting again."],
  ["Knows when something is unclear", "Instead of guessing, Kurukoo asks a concise clarification question when it lacks the information needed to act safely."],
  ["Turns conversations into action", "It works out the right next step, selects the appropriate capability, and coordinates tasks, services, providers, agents, or people when needed."],
  ["Connects the dots across your life", "Kurukoo can use approved profile information, preferences, recurring needs, previous requests, reminders, and outcomes to reduce repetition and provide more relevant help."],
  ["Learns your preferences over time", "With your permission, it can remember how you like to communicate, what matters to you, and how you prefer tasks and updates to be handled."],
  ["Prioritises what needs your attention", "Kurukoo can surface important requests, reminders, notifications, deadlines, blockers, and progress updates so you know what matters next."],
  ["Coordinates complex requests", "A simple request such as “I need someone to repair this” can become a structured process: understand the need, identify requirements, find suitable help, coordinate the next step, and track progress."],
  ["Uses specialised Kurukoo intelligence", "Its AI is designed to understand Kurukoo’s own concepts, services, requests, providers, agents, memory, notifications, Topics, Radar, and user workflows."],
  ["Maintains continuity across channels", "Your context can continue across Chat and supported channels rather than creating separate, disconnected assistants."],
  ["Separates suggestions from truth", "AI can interpret, reason, recommend, and draft, while authoritative Kurukoo services control permissions, payments, fulfilment, evidence, and external actions."],
  ["Does not invent results", "Kurukoo should not claim that a provider is verified, a payment succeeded, a service is available, or a task was completed without reliable evidence."],
  ["Keeps actions bounded and safe", "Consequential actions require the appropriate authorisation, confirmation, policy checks, and canonical service controls."],
  ["Improves through evaluation", "Kurukoo’s intelligence can be refined using privacy-safe, curated examples and tested against ambiguity, contradictory inputs, safety scenarios, and real product workflows."],
  ["Gets smarter about the route to the outcome", "You start with the result you want; Kurukoo works out whether the best route is software assistance, a reminder, a provider, a business, an agent, or another supported service."],
