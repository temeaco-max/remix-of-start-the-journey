# Kurukoo Client Feature Coverage Matrix

This matrix prevents client work from forgetting OS capabilities. It is a coverage map, not a claim that every external provider is live.

## Client families

- **Web App:** marketing + authenticated browser application.
- **PWA:** mobile-oriented Web App client with install/offline/update capabilities.
- **Native:** iOS + Android Expo client.
- **Admin:** operator/control plane.

## Representation rule

If a feature exists in the OS but is not useful as a full standalone navigation destination, represent it through the appropriate canonical surface: Chat, Agent, Requests, Tasks, Discover, Connect, Account, contextual cards, notifications or Admin.

Do not hide a capability simply because an external provider is not configured. Show the appropriate readiness/disabled/setup-required state.

## Client navigation rule

### Mobile/PWA primary navigation

1. Agent
2. Discover
3. Requests
4. Tasks
5. Connect

Secondary areas include Wallet, Points, Top Up, Subscriptions, Profile, Memory, Artifacts, Notifications, Capabilities and Settings.

### Web App

The authenticated Web App uses clean canonical routes. `/desk` is the workspace home and `/chat` is the one user-facing Agent/conversation surface. `/agents` is the separate Agent directory/runtime surface. Legacy `/app/*` paths are compatibility aliases only and must normalize to their clean canonical destinations; `/app/agent` specifically normalizes to `/chat`, never `/desk`.

The Web App must retain the mobile/PWA information architecture beneath its responsive composition. Dedicated product jobs remain on their canonical surfaces rather than being replaced by a generic Desk or Chat fallback.

### Marketing

Marketing pages explain and attract; they do not implement a parallel version of authenticated OS behavior. CTAs hand off to the Web App/Chat using canonical routes and identity.

### Admin

Admin surfaces operational controls and evidence; it does not become another user-facing execution engine.

## Completion states

Each feature is tracked independently as:

- represented;
- implemented;
- contract-tested;
- credential/device-ready;
- live-verified;
- production-active.

This prevents “present UI” from being mistaken for “complete system” and prevents missing keys from being mistaken for missing code.
