# Kurukoo Page Architecture Matrix

**Status:** Active product specification
**Purpose:** Ensure Kurukoo's visual convergence never removes information, functionality, navigation, SEO structure, state coverage, or truth boundaries that a real-world page or capability requires.

## Governing rule

**Visual design governs presentation, not product completeness.** A visual reference may determine hierarchy, spacing, typography, component treatment, density, colour, motion and composition. It may not be used as the reason to remove a section, workflow, state, action, navigation path, SEO requirement, data relationship, evidence boundary, or capability that belongs to the page's real-world purpose.

Every surface must satisfy all of these dimensions before it can be marked complete:

1. Purpose and audience are explicit.
2. Real-world user jobs are covered.
3. Required information architecture is present.
4. Primary, secondary and recovery actions exist.
5. Navigation and cross-surface continuation exist.
6. Empty, loading, pending, needs-input, success, failure, unavailable, cancelled and recovery states are appropriate to the surface.
7. Canonical data/authority ownership is explicit.
8. Trust/evidence boundaries are visible where relevant.
9. SEO/indexability is correct for the surface type.
10. Accessibility, focus, keyboard and touch requirements are satisfied.
11. Desktop and responsive composition use the shared visual system without deleting content.
12. The visual surface does not claim an external/provider/payment/fulfilment outcome without canonical evidence.

## Surface classes

### Chat and conversation surfaces

Chat is not merely another page; it is the universal interaction surface. Its information architecture must cover:

- conversation list/history;
- new conversation;
- active conversation;
- message stream;
- typing/activity state;
- voice state;
- composer/actions/attachments;
- context inspector;
- current request/goal;
- memory context;
- Nearby/discovery context;
- notifications;
- continuation cards;
- skill requirement capture;
- Economic Request cards;
- deferred/waiting states;
- provider/evidence states;
- confirmation/cancellation;
- errors and retries;
- guest/authenticated boundary;
- sign-in continuation;
- channel continuation;
- offline/reconnect;
- safety/emergency interruption;
- agent pause/resume/cancel;
- natural-language clarification without forcing users through forms unnecessarily.

The Chat visual system may change layout density, but none of those product responsibilities may disappear because they were absent from a visual reference frame.

### Admin / Control Room

Admin is an operational OS, not a consumer surface.

Every Admin module uses the pattern:

`scope/header → search/filter → queue/list/table → detail → evidence → action → confirmation → audit trail → recovery`

| Admin area | Required real-world content |
|---|---|
| Control Room | platform health, readiness, operational integrations, queues, incidents, major metrics, audit/recovery links |
| Conversations | search, conversation identity, participant/context, safety/policy state, messages/metadata as permitted, handoff/escalation, audit |
| Providers | provider search, profile, capabilities, verification/evidence, availability, trust, requests, disputes, sanctions |
| Economic | requests, orders, quotes, payment/escrow, fulfilment, disputes, cancellation, evidence |
| Moderation | reports, queue, content/user context, decision, reason, appeal/audit |
| Compliance | policy exceptions, evidence, retention/privacy, access, review queue, audit |
| Notifications | queue, delivery/read state, provider/device status, failures, retry/cancel, audit |
| Integrations | provider readiness, credentials/config state (never raw secrets), health, activation gates, test actions, evidence |
| Agents | agent identity, goals, runtime, tools, risk, approvals, actions, retries, pause/cancel, evidence |
| Users | search, profile, trust/evidence, memory/privacy status, activity, economic history, flags, controls, audit |
| Pricing | plans, entitlements, regional pricing, copy/state, billing readiness, experiments/audit |
| Referrals | attribution, qualification, fraud checks, rewards, pending/approved/reversed, audit |
| Commissions | rules, earned/pending/paid/reversed, contributor/provider, audit |
| Partnerships | applications, organizations, contracts/status, capabilities, readiness, contacts, audit |
| Scam & trust | reports, risk signals, evidence, decisions, restrictions, recovery, audit |
| Social | moderation and community/creator operations |
| Creators | profile, content, campaigns, eligibility, payouts/rewards, moderation |
| Celebrity | profile, representation, requests, availability, evidence, campaigns, privacy |
| Analytics | product/operational metrics, filters, cohorts, source definitions, export, data freshness |
| Revenue | gross/net/reconciled, payment/provider evidence, subscriptions, commissions, refunds/disputes |
| Marketing | campaigns, audience boundary, creatives, approvals, spend/serving state, audit |
| Advertising | campaigns, inventory, targeting boundary, creative review, placement, serving, spend, moderation |
| Content | content queue, SEO content, topic/resource status, moderation, publication, revision history |
| Curation | discovery/resource/topic curation queue, ranking signals, evidence, editor decisions |
| Settings | feature flags/readiness, policy, operator settings, integrations, audit |
| SEO | URL inventory, title/meta, canonical, index state, redirects, schema, content completeness, warnings |
| Roadmap | product priorities, status, dependencies, evidence and owner |

## Cross-system feature inventory

The page matrix must also account for capabilities that do not have a standalone page. These must appear in the correct conversation, workspace, Admin, channel, or native surface rather than being lost because they do not have a page mockup.

### Identity, trust and account

Phone-first authentication; email OTP where enabled; magic links; push approval; trusted devices; progressive identity; guest continuation; channel evidence; QR referral/context attribution; account/profile; privacy; logout; auth challenge recovery; session expiry; re-entry.

### Conversation intelligence

LLM semantic interpretation; context arbitration; reference resolution; topic switching; interruption; clarification; conversation-only exploration; action proposals; exact-object resolution; natural correction; confirmation; cancellation; follow-up; cross-turn goal preservation; model selection; local model fallback; template fallback; quality/repair; truth boundaries.

### Capability catalogue

All canonical skills and operations in `skillFlows.ts` and the canonical capability catalogue are included by reference. The registry currently covers the repository's 205 skills across 46 families and projects the broader capability vocabulary used by model reasoning and execution. Every skill family must map to a surface contract, outcome/lifecycle contract, UI-state contract, canonical owner, and recovery path. Presence in a registry or route is not completion evidence.

### Economic/network capabilities

Discovery; provider matching; worker/services; products/inventory; seller/buyer; ordering; requests; quote; payment; escrow; fulfilment; dispatch; delivery; cancellation; dispute; reviews; ratings/trust; contributors; events/evidence; opportunities; referrals; commissions; Points; subscriptions; Wallet; Top Up; Money Circle; promotion/advertising; sponsored discovery; saved/follow/watch.

### Personal OS capabilities

Memory; reminders; tasks; notifications; safety; check-ins; trusted contacts; artifacts; voice; call/WebRTC boundary; Connect; channels; linked devices; Nearby Pulse/Radar; location consent; daily picks; Topics; prayer companion; agents; capabilities; opportunities.

### Content and community

Topics; replies; reports; moderation; resources; articles; source attribution; editorial freshness; public discovery; legal; privacy; help; contact; careers; partner information; developer/API documentation; SEO/admin content lifecycle.

### Channel/network capability surfaces

Web Chat; PWA; WhatsApp adapter/readiness; Telegram bot/personal linked-device boundary; SMS; Email; USSD; FCM/PWA push; voice; WebRTC; QR context; linked devices; connected resources; Google Drive; Sheets; Notion; Microsoft sources; MQTT/IoT foundation.

### State language that must exist everywhere it applies

`Ready`, `Needs setup`, `Needs your input`, `Pending`, `Waiting`, `Deferred`, `Connected`, `Not connected`, `Verifying`, `Verified`, `Unavailable`, `Blocked`, `Failed`, `Retry`, `Cancelled`, `Completed`, `Saved`, `Paused`, `Expired`, `Delivery unavailable`, `Payment unavailable`, `Provider unavailable`, `Awaiting provider`, `Awaiting confirmation`, `Awaiting evidence`.

These semantic states must map consistently to visual treatment, copy, accessible labels and allowed actions.

## SEO architecture

Public/indexable surfaces must have:

- unique search intent and H1;
- title and meta description that answer that intent;
- canonical URL;
- sensible internal-link graph;
- descriptive URLs/slugs;
- breadcrumbs where useful;
- structured data only when truthful;
- image/social metadata where appropriate;
- index/noindex strategy per surface class;
- pagination/canonical strategy for listings;
- source/author/date/update semantics for editorial material;
- no thin placeholder page manufactured only to match a design board;
- meaningful content above and below the fold;
- related resources/topics/Chat continuation where appropriate.

Authenticated and private operational pages should use appropriate `noindex`/access controls and are not required to become SEO landing pages. API/admin/private implementation surfaces are operational documentation rather than public consumer SEO pages unless explicitly designated otherwise.

## Navigation architecture

Every page must answer:

- Where am I?
- What can I do here?
- What is the next best action?
- How do I return to the originating conversation or object?
- Where do I go for adjacent tasks?
- What happens if the action cannot proceed?

Public site navigation, authenticated Web App navigation, Chat navigation and Admin navigation remain separate authorities but must provide deliberate cross-plane bridges where appropriate.

## Completion rule

A feature/page/component/functionality/aim may only be marked **complete** when its purpose, information architecture, interaction flow, canonical owner, data/state semantics, visual treatment, navigation/recovery, accessibility, and required external/SEO boundaries are all accounted for.

A design reference cannot reduce this contract.

## Canonical source hierarchy

When sources disagree, use this order:

1. canonical runtime owner and route/component implementation;
2. `docs/architecture/BLUEPRINT_TRUTH.md` and `CURRENT_PRODUCT_TRUTH.md`;
3. canonical skill/capability registries and feature flags;
4. active design system/screen-set specifications;
5. historical design boards/screenshots;
6. historical TODO/roadmap prose.

Historical visuals must never delete functionality that the active runtime/product truth requires.
